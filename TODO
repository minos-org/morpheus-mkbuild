bob:
	Get the cflags and ldflags of dependencies of $DEPS in a package?
	For example when I use xorglibx11 as DEPS in a package, xorglibx11 has
	xorgxproto as $DEPS. How would I resolve that without specifying xorgxproto
	as DEPS in a package? With this we can get rid of pkg-config --static --[libs|cflags]

	Maybe add a command like (not sure):

		mk TARG='pkg' deplist    - print $DEPS list.
		mk TARG='pkg' depcflags  - get all cflags of dependencies (DEPS_CFLAGS).
		mk TARG='pkg' depldflags - get all ldflags of dependencies (DEPS_LDFLAGS).
